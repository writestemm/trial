<p align="justify">STEMM “inreach” and “outreach” require learners and practitioners to read and write in both technical and non-technical registers. Although the teaching of these skills is gaining momentum both in STEMM policies and STEMM institutions, a systematic intervention is required in developing pedagogies and curricula for teaching reading and writing in STEMM. To fill this gap, the Symposium solicits Abstract Submissions on the themes of pedagogical and curriculur developments in the field of reading and writing courses in STEMM.</p>

Topics of Interest include but are not limited to:

<ul>
<li>Curricular and pedagogical reflections on teaching reading and/or writing in STEMM</li>
<li>Sketching the STEMM reading-writing teacher</li>
<li>Uses and abuses of generative AI</li>
<li>Role of reading-writing in domain-specific STEMM knowledge</li>
<li>Interdisciplinary reflections</li>
<li>Frameworks for developing reading-writing curricula for STEMM disciplines in India</li>
<li>Empirical investigations into reading and writing in STEMM</li>
</ul>
