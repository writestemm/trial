<h1 class="post-title" style="color:DarkMagenta;"><b>Guidelines for Abstract Submission</b></h1>

<p align="justify">Potential presenters at the symposium are advised to follow the guidelines below while submitting their abstracts. Abstracts that do not follow the guidelines provided will be summarily rejected.</p>

<ul>
<li> Please submit your abstract as a PDF document using this <a href="https://forms.gle/TRG6sBLdEkyAL56E8" target="_blank">Google Form</a>.</li>

<li><p align="justify">Each abstract must have a title, the names and affiliations of authors, their contact details, the abstract body, and five keywords. Please download this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kzvgc1P2Id_4b5_bvNzSsvjvyzYejDeQILXRncgZlHY/edit" target="_blank">template</a> while preparing the abstract. To download the template, please navigate to File → Download → Microsoft Word (.docx).</p></li>

<li><p align="justify">We recommend authors have references for key claims in the abstract. In-text citations and references must be organized according to the <a href="https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/reference_list_basic_rules.html" target="_blank">APA (7th Edition) guidelines</a>.</p></li>

<li><p align="justify">The abstract must include a brief context, the key argument, and the evidence that the author will provide for the same. For papers that report empirical studies, please provide a brief summary of the methodology and the findings.</p></li>

<li>Abstracts should be between 300-500 words. Multiple paragraphs are allowed and encouraged.</li>
</ul>

 <h1 class="post-title" style="color:DarkMagenta;"><b>Format of the Symposium</b></h1>


<p align="justify">This symposium intends to be an opportunity to potentiate critical conversations around the teaching of reading and writing in STEMM, especially in an Indian context. Additionally, this symposium will act as a prelude to a 2026 special issue of Contemporary Education Dialogue (SAGE) on the same theme. Thus, this symposium adopts the following format:</p>

<li><p align="justify">Authors are to prepare a working paper of ~3000 words once their abstracts are accepted. The working papers are to be submitted to the coordinators by 30 December 2024, after which they will be presented at the symposium. It is mandatory that the working papers are submitted before the symposium.</p>

<p align="justify">Note: We do not expect the working papers to be full and final drafts. Instead, the working papers should give us a sense of the main argument of the paper and the way the author is arriving at/substantiating this argument. A subset of these manuscripts that align well with the vision of the special issue and the expected quality will be considered for publication in the special issue.</p></li>

<li> <p align="justify">The symposium will be a forum where authors present their working papers to a peer community, and seek feedback on their work.</p></li>

<li> <p align="justify">The symposium will have dedicated workshop sessions on academic writing that will aid the authors develop their manuscripts for submission.</p>

<p align="justify">Note: Manuscripts that are selected for potential publication to the special issue will be contacted separately for details of the peer review process and publication process.</p></li>

<li> <p align="justify">The coordinators are trying to organize funds to pay each presenter a token honorarium. This is subject to successful mobilization of funds.</p></li>


<h1 class="post-title" style="color:DarkMagenta;"><b>Important Information</b></h1>

<ul>
<li> <p align="justify">By submitting your abstract, you commit to submitting the working paper by the deadline mentioned in this concept note, and are willing to have your working paper considered for potential publication in the 2026 special issue of Contemporary Education Dialogue.</p></li>

<li> <p align="justify">Submitted working papers might be used by facilitators of the academic writing workshops during the symposium as examples. In such use, the working papers will be anonymised. We understand that having your work publicly reviewed could be a source of potential discomfort. However, in our experience, grounding academic writing workshops in specific examples has been helpful in developing working papers into effective manuscripts. The symposium will strive to be a safe, non-judgemental space that enables participants to give and receive constructive feedback.</p></li>

<li> <p align="justify">All presenters will be provided with a participation certificate.</p></li>

<li> <p align="justify">Acceptance of abstracts or consideration of working papers for development into full manuscripts for the special issue does not guarantee publication in the special issue. The final call for the suitability of the manuscript lies with the editors of Contemporary Education Dialogue, and their decision will be final and binding.</p></li>
</ul>
